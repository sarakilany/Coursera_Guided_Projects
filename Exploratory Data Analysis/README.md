# Overview

1-hour long project-based course, you will learn exploratory data analysis techniques and create visual methods to analyze trends, patterns, and relationships in the data. By the end of this project, you will have applied EDA on a real-world dataset.

This class is for learners who want to use Python for applying data visualization and data analysis, and for learners who are currently taking a basic machine learning course or have already finished a machine learning course and are searching for a practical data visualization and analysis project course. Also, this project provides learners with basic knowledge about exploratory analysis and improves their skills in creating maps which helps them in fulfilling their career goals by adding this project to their portfolios.

# Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

- Understanding the concept of Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Creating Visual methods to analyze the data.
- Analyzing trends, patterns, relationships in the data.
- By the end of this course, you will be able to apply exploratory data analysis to real-world datasets.

# Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:
1. Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: This is the hands-on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
3. Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment to obtain the certificate.
