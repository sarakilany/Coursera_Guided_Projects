# Overview
In this project, you will learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. In this project, we are going to work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

# Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on 3 learning objectives:

1. Learn the steps, needed to be taken to prepare your data sources for an analysis
2. Learn how to look at your data to find a good measure to establish your analysis based upon
3. Learn to visualize the result of your analysis
By the end of this course, you will learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. in this Course we are going to work with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country.

# Course Structure
This course is divided into 4 parts:

# Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
COVID19 Data Analysis using Python: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
# Project Structure
The hands on project on COVID19 Data Analysis using Python is divided into following tasks:

## Task 1: Introduction
Understand the purpose of the project, the datasets that will be used, and the question we will answer with our analysis.

## Task 2: Importing COVID19 dataset
Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

## Task 3: Finding a good Measure
Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.

## Task 4: Importing World happiness report dataset
Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.

## Task 5: Visualizing the results
Visualize our results using Seaborn.
